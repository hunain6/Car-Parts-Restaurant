# Car-Parts-Restaurant
This project is a frontend website for the Car Parts Restaurant, a unique concept that blends automotive passion with culinary experiences. Designed for car enthusiasts and food lovers alike, the website features a responsive layout built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring smooth navigation across all devices. The platform includes multiple sections: a restaurant homepage with an engaging introduction, an auto parts store for shopping, community forums for discussions, and event/contact pages.

The design reflects a modern, automotive-inspired aesthetic while maintaining user-friendly functionality. Whether visitors want to explore the restaurant menu, browse car parts, or join enthusiast conversations, the interface provides an intuitive experience. Future enhancements could include e-commerce integration, user authentication for forums, and an online reservation system.

This project showcases frontend development skills in creating a visually appealing, interactive website for a niche brand. Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or adapt the concept for other hybrid business ideas! For more details, connect with me on LinkedIn or check out my portfolio.
